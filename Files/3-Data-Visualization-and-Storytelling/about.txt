# Let’s bring the data to life

So, you’ve got a clean data set and you’ve done some analysis - what next?

What you'll learn in this task:

As we said earlier, your job as a data analyst is to connect the business and the data. You’ll need to communicate the relevant insights in a way that is clear, concise and engaging for your client and team members.

This will involve bringing the data to life using visualizations. You’ll learn to choose the right data visualizations that best support the story you want to tell.

What you'll do in this task:

You’ll create a powerpoint presentation for Social Buzz that reports on their content performance.

It’s time for your data visualization and story telling skills to shine!

# Build your presentation Structure

Importantly, before you start creating your data charts, you should plan your presentation structure. This will ensure your presentation answers the right questions.

Here is a template that we would use at Accenture to create a presentation. You need to download this template and populate slides 2-6.

	Accenture Presentation Template

For each slide, think about: 

	Agenda - What will your presentation cover?
	Project Recap - What are the key points from the brief?
	Problem - What is the problem that you answer in this presentation?
	The Analytics team - Who is on your team?
		As a reminder from the earlier task - this includes: Andrew Fleming (Chief Technical Architect), Marcus Rompton (Senior Principle), and yourself!
	Process - How did you complete your analysis?

Once you’ve populated slides 2-6 - complete the quick knowledge check to move onto the next step.

In the next step, we’ll review what you’ve included before we start charting.

If you can't open the powerpoint template, here is a PDF version for you to use:

# Quiz
Question 1 of 1
Have you completed slides 2-6 in your presentation?
      x Yes!
	Not yet

Great Work!
Great! Let's move on.

# Quick explanation
Great work! To ensure you're on the right track, have a look at these annotated images to see how a professional at Accenture would have completed slides 2-6. 

Notice how the information is clear and concise, and summarizes the most important points. You can click on each image to expand it.

When you're done, move onto the next step and we'll add in some charts!

# Create your charts
The final step of this task is to populate slides 7 - 10 with your data insights.

If you’ve lost your spreadsheet, we’ve attached one here again for you to use.

We know that the client wants to understand the top 5 content categories. Have a think about what are the best ways to present this? In a pie chart? In a bar chart?

There are also some other interesting insights that we might want to share with them. For example:

	How many unique categories are there?
	How many reactions are there to the most popular category?
	What was the month with the most posts?

If you get stuck, here is a resource on how to make charts in excel.

Once your slides are complete with your data insights and charts, upload your work to see the example answer in the next step.

# Data Visualization Explained
Nice work completing the data visualization exercise!

Like we’ve said, it’s important to keep your presentation simple and clean - take a look at the annotated example images to see how you could have visualized the data. 

You could have done it differently, and that’s okay! There are lots of different ways that you can bring data to life.

Now let’s go to your final step where you will practice your presentation skills!
