Task Three

# Let’s bring the data to life

So, you’ve got a clean data set and you’ve done some analysis - what next?

What you'll learn in this task:

As we said earlier, your job as a data analyst is to connect the business and the data. You’ll need to communicate the relevant insights in a way that is clear, concise and engaging for your client and team members.

This will involve bringing the data to life using visualizations. You’ll learn to choose the right data visualizations that best support the story you want to tell.

What you'll do in this task:

You’ll create a powerpoint presentation for Social Buzz that reports on their content performance.

It’s time for your data visualization and story telling skills to shine!

# Build your presentation Structure

Importantly, before you start creating your data charts, you should plan your presentation structure. This will ensure your presentation answers the right questions.

Here is a template that we would use at Accenture to create a presentation. You need to download this template and populate slides 2-6.

	Accenture Presentation Template

For each slide, think about: 

	Agenda - What will your presentation cover?
	Project Recap - What are the key points from the brief?
	Problem - What is the problem that you answer in this presentation?
	The Analytics team - Who is on your team?
		As a reminder from the earlier task - this includes: Andrew Fleming (Chief Technical Architect), Marcus Rompton (Senior Principle), and yourself!
	Process - How did you complete your analysis?

Once you’ve populated slides 2-6 - complete the quick knowledge check to move onto the next step.

In the next step, we’ll review what you’ve included before we start charting.

If you can't open the powerpoint template, here is a PDF version for you to use:
