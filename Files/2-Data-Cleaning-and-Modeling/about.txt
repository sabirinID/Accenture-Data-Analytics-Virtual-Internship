Task Two: Data Cleaning & Modeling
Modeling data to create valuable insights.

	What you'll learn
		How to use data models as a way to identify the right dataset to use, this is called requirements gathering
		The importance of data cleaning and modelling to prepare for data analysis

	What you'll do
		Review a data model to select data sets and complete a quick knowledge check
		Clean and combine data sets in a spreadsheet and upload a completed file

# Let's dive into the data

Now you have a good understanding of the project and your role - it’s time to get to work!

Don’t worry if you haven’t done data analysis before, we’ll take you through each step and provide support along the way.

So, let’s have a look at what data you have to work with. The client has sent through:

	7 data sets - each data set contains different columns and values
	A data model - this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.

There is a lot of information here and it’s easy to get lost in the data. So, to make sure you are using the right data to answer the business questions you’ll follow these steps:

	1. Requirements gathering
	2. Data cleaning
	3. Data modelling

# First up, requirements gathering

As we mentioned, you have been sent 7 datasets and a data model.

Often you won’t need all these datasets to find what you’re looking for.

So, the first step is to use this data model to identify which datasets will be required to answer your business question - which is to to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.

When you think you’ve identified the right data sets to include, complete the multi choice quiz to move onto the next step.

Here are some resources to help you
How do you interpret a data model?

Definitions of different data types:

	String - Sequence of characters, digits, or symbols—always treated as text
	UUID - Universally Unique Identifiers
	Array - List with a number of elements in a specific order—typically of the same type
	Integer - Numeric data type for numbers without fractions
	Timestamp - Number of seconds that have elapsed since midnight (00:00:00 UTC), 1st January 1970 (Unix time)
