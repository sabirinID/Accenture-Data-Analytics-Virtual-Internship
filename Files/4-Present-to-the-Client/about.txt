# It’s presentation time!

Your Managing Director Mae is really impressed with your presentation. She wants you to present the findings to the client.

So, in this task, you will be presenting to Social Buzz and your Accenture team in person. We know presentations can be nerve wracking, but it’s an essential skill for a data analyst to develop.

Let’s go!

# Presentation tips

When presenting to the client there are a few things that you should remember:

	1. They may not all be familiar with data, so you need to make sure you talk to them in business-friendly language.
 
	2. You want to show them that you’ve understood their business and requirements, so use their terminology and language relevant to the task.
 
	3. This is your time to shine and to show them how great you are! Try to present your work with confidence and conviction, if you don’t feel confident talking about your results then it’s a good indication that you don’t understand them fully or may need to revisit the dataset! Speaking about your results should feel natural when you explain what you’ve done.
 
	4. A good presentation always takes a lot of preparation. The more you practice presenting your content, the more confident you will be when the time comes. Practice with your housemates, friends, family, anyone that is free! Ask for feedback and keep improving until you’re happy with your presentation and you’re confident in presenting your content.
 
Let’s keep going, you’re nearly finished!

# Record your video

It is now time to record your presentation to the client.

Remember, your presentation should be concise, engaging and should tell a compelling story. It should be no longer than 10 minutes.

Recording the video may require a few attempts until you’re happy with it, but this task shouldn't take you longer than 30 minutes.

While the recording functionality in this task won't allow you to share your slides as you speak, it will help you learn how to communicate and use eye contact when presenting.
